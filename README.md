![](https://github.com/gipfeli-io/gipfeli-frontend/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=stage)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

> **_NOTE:_** If you copy the .env.example file to create a new .env file please be aware that comments on the same
> line as variables (e.g. `SOME_VAR= #this is the comment`) must be removed, otherwise there will be build errors.

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm i` to set up all dependencies
3. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` and adjust the values
4. Run `npm start` to get a development process with hot-reloading running

## Tests

Run the testsuite using `npm run test`. This will run all tests.

## Build

In order to create a production-ready build, run `npm run build`.
